    "[NanoEvents](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/api/coffea.nanoaod.NanoEvents.html#coffea.nanoaod.NanoEvents) is a Coffea utility to wrap the CMS NanoAOD (or similar) flat nTuple structure into a single awkward array with appropriate object methods (such as Lorentz vector methods), cross references, and pre-built nested objects, all lazily accessed from the source ROOT TTree via uproot. NanoEvents is in a **experimental** stage at this point. Certain functionality may be fragile, and some functionality will not be available until it is ported to awkward-array version 1.\n",
